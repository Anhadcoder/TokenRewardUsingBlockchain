Transfer Ownership: The teacher role can be transferred to another address.
MetaMask Integration: Connects to the user's MetaMask wallet for interaction with the blockchain.
Future Scope:

Implement additional functionalities like token transfer between users.
Integrate with learning management systems for automated token rewards based on activity.
Develop a mobile application for user convenience.
